# React-Tutorial
 In this repository I'll made the steps of the "[React 16.6 - The Complete Guide (incl. React Router &amp; Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)" course.

The repository is divided by the main topics and each one is divided by the different course steps/lessons (step is not equal to video). Each step contains a readme with the explanation of the step and, if is change from the previous step, the new code.
