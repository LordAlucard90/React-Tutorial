# React-Tutorial
 In this repository I'll made the steps of the
"[React - The Complete Guide (incl. Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)" course.

The repository is divided by the main topics and each one
is divided by the different course steps/lessons (step is not equal to video).
Each step contains a readme with the explanation of the step and,
if is change from the previous step, the new code.
